<H1>Domain Name Registration</H1>

<P>Do you want to have your own website where you can publish something?
Just pick a name, and go to one of these to register the name. If you don't
want to have your own domain, then perhaps you should try a free website
(usually comes with some advertising), like <A
  href="http://www.wordpress.com/">WordPress</A>.</P>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> will host public websites
and include built in version control for the more tech savvy web master.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost.com</a> host unlimited domains
and subdomains. They are fast, located in Utah, and have great tech support.
They have a ton of auto-install software for your website and
very up to date software.</p>

<P><A href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</A> - an inexpensive
registrar that provides <a

with their registration.</P>
