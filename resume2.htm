    <p>"Lou is exceedingly customer oriented (both internal and external) and
    always strives to ensure that the outputs of his tasks meet or exceed their
    expectations. This carries over to even tasks that he is not directly
    responsible for in that he is always more than willing to help others
    overcome whatever obstacles they face so that they can succeed."</p>
