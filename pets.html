<h2>Digger</h2>
<div align="left">Digger is Joshua's pet hamster. &nbsp;We got him after
the other pet hamster died. &nbsp;We got him at the pet store - called PetSmart.

These are his funnels - fun tunnels. &nbsp;Joshua bought them with his allowance.
&nbsp;He gets one dollar for each year of age.. &nbsp;He gives one dollar
for church, two dollars for savings, and four dollars to spend as he wants.<br>

Digger likes to climb up the tubes to the observation deck, and often sleeps
at the entrance.<br>

<h2>Rebel</h2>
Rebel likes to be fed every morning when dad leaves for work. &nbsp;She is
particular about the kind of food that we feed her. &nbsp;Rebel has an attitude.
&nbsp;She will let you play with her for a little bit, but then may bite you
for fun. &nbsp;She also likes to play with a string on a stick.<br>

<h2>Fighter</h2>
Fighter is Joshua's beta fish. &nbsp;He feeds the fish three specks of food
every day. &nbsp;The fish gets excited when Joshua feeds him. &nbsp;The fish
likes it when the kids come around.<br>

<h2>Megan</h2>
Megan is our dog. &nbsp;We have had her for as long as mom and dad have been
married, and she was two years old then. &nbsp;She is very nice to us. &nbsp;She
is an outdoor dog.<br>
