<P>I use these photos for wallpaper on my computer.  
Most modern desktops, 
like <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 
or <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>, 
support wallpaper in JPEG format.  
If your desktop does not, use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a> 
or <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> to convert it 
to a BMP for your screen size.  
I used <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> to make 
the thumbnails for this page.  I just copied the images to another directory, 
and ran:<br>
<code>mogrify -resize 256x thumbs/*.jpg</code>

    <TD>
    I shot this using a Polaroid PDC1300 digital camera 
    at <a href="http://www.callawayonline.com/">Callaway Gardens</a>.  
    They have a butterfly center where thousands of tropical butterflies 
    flutter freely through the air.
    You really have to know your camera.  The PDC1300 is a dog when it comes 
    to shooting action.  But it shows off the butterfly wing motion quite well.

    <TD>
    I shot this using a Polaroid PDC1300 digital camera 
    at <a href="http://www.callawayonline.com/">Callaway Gardens</a>.  
    It is also tedious to change the settings, like the macro 
    lens setting.  It also doesn't give good white balance, so I usually end up
    using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a> to set the white or black 
    level along with the gamma value.

    </TD>
    <TD>
    I shot this butterfly using a Canon PowerShot A75 digital camera at a local nature preserve.  
    The Canon PowerShot A75 doesn't do pink, red, or purple flowers very well.
    Perhaps it has something to do with the auto white balance.
    The pink flowers are from an azalia bush.

    I shot this using a Polaroid PDC1300 digital camera at <a href="http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/">Montgomery College</a> in Germantown, Maryland.  The cherry and dogwood trees were bloom, and I was there for a meeting.  I added a fill flash since the sun was behind the tree.

    <TD>
    I photographed the coral using a Polaroid PDC1300 digital camera 
    at the <a href="http://www.tnaqua.org/">Tennessee Aquarium</a>, 
    located on the banks of the Tennessee River in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  
    I had to color balance the photo using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a>.  
    The color balance is located under Layers->Colors->Levels or 
    Tools->Colors->Levels.
    Choose the black eyedropper and pick a spot on the photo that was 
    supposed to be black.

    <TD>
    I photographed a nearby stream using a Canon PowerShot A75 
    digital camera.  The small stream is located down the street 
    from my house.  The camera has a slow action setting which 
    I thought would work well on the white water.

    <TD>
    This sunset was taken at Sims Elementary School in Conyers, Georgia.  
    When taking a sunset photo, you often have to change the camera to 
    manual mode so that you can underexpose the photo.  
    Underexposing the photo will allow a more full color range in the sky.  
    Fortunately, the Canon PowerShot A75 had manual mode!

    <TD>
    I was shooting some dolphins at the Sea World Dolphin Nursery in Orlando, Florida, and thought that a photo of the water would look great as a texture. Either that or I missed the dolphin as it swam by since digital cameras do not always capture the photo when you tell them to.  Well, it also makes a nice desktop background.  I cropped the photo a little to get rid of the edge of the tank using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a>.
