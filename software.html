<p>Since I write software for a living, I thought I should dedicate some
web space for some stuff that I have worked on. I mostly write embedded C
for PC based controllers, but I have dabbled in a few other areas as well.</p>

I posted about software using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and called
the site <a href="http://steve.kargs.net/">Steve's Software Trek</a>.
How original! Now it is hosted at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>

  <h3>My Software</h3>

<p><a href="psp.html">The Personal Software Process (with ANSI C
source code)</a></p>

<p><a href="elevator.html">An object oriented elevator simulator design
(with C++ source code)</a></p>

<p><a href="code/compact.c">compact.c</a> - An idea for code from Circuit
Cellar - Test Your EQ - programmed in C - using some extreme programming
techniques.  <a href="code/factors.c">factors.c</a> - a little program that gives the factors of a given integer.</p>

<p><a href="code/mailto.c">mailto.c</a> - Obfuscate your e-mail address to
reduce the chance of a spam-bot harvesting it.</p>

<p><a href="code/keylist.c">keylist.c</a>,
 <a href="code/keylist.h">keylist.h</a>,
 <a href="code/key.h">key.h</a> -
A linked list library programmed in C - using some extreme programming
techniques.  The linked lists are sorted by key as they are added, and
can be retrieved by key, index, or FIFO.  This library is useful for
caching dynamic data by key, such as BACnet I-Am data for each Device Object.
Of course, I updated the <a href="code/keylist.tgz">keylist library</a> to use
a dynamic array and binary search, so it is much faster now.  I was also
fascinated with embedded software ring buffers, but wanted to create a
generic ring buffer library.  After a couple of iterations,
the <a href="code/ringbuf.tgz">Ring Buffer Library</a> was created
and includes unit tests.  Unit tests not only verify the functionality
of the software, but also provide examples of how to use the API.</p>

<p><a href="code/bacenum.h">bacenum.h</a> - BACnet has quite a few
enumerations, so I coded up a header file for C.  Basically a cut and paste
from the standard, and then a little cleanup to make it a C header.  I also
wrote the MS/TP (Master Slave/Token Passing) Data Link layer by basically doing
a cut and paste from the standard - <a href="code/mstp.c">mstp.c</a>.  Am I
just bored?  No, I make some time in the mornings when I wake up to do things
like read <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, e-mail, and eat
breakfast, and during Christmas 2003 vacation I wanted to see how difficult it
would be to write it.  It took me one morning to complete the Receive State
Machine and another morning to complete the Master Node State Machine.  I have
it on good authority that you should implement the Master Node State Machine
rather than the Slave Node.  I also coded up a <a
  href="http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/">BACnet protocol stack</a> for embedded
devices.  What are you waiting for?  A protocol analyzer?  Detailed BACnet
protocol information is supported by the open source and cross platform
protocol analyzer <a href="http://www.ethereal.com/">Ethereal</a> since version
0.10.11.</p>

<p><a href="code/dbuffer.c">dbuffer.c</a>, <a href="code/dbuffer.h">dbuffer.h</a> - A dynamic buffer library.  <a href="code/dstring.c">dstring.c</a>, <a href="code/dstring.h">dstring.h</a> - a dynamic string library that relies on the GNU vasprintf function.  These are nice little libraries that allow you the programmer to focus on getting the work done, and not on keeping track of a buffer and how big it is and is it big enough and have I overflowed it.</p>

<p><a href="code/sbuf.tgz">sbuf.tgz</a> - A static buffer library.  A little library that tracks the length of a buffer and prevents buffer overflows.  It stores the size and length along with the pointer to the buffer, and has a couple of functions for accessing the buffer.</p>

<p><a href="code/enumtext.c">enumtext.c</a>, <a href="code/enumtext.h">enumtext.h</a> -  A simple library that takes a list of strings that are mapped to enumerations, and provides an easily maintainable way to get the strings when given the enumeration.  Includes unit tests.</p>

<p><a href="code/stdbool.h">stdbool.h</a>, <a href="code/stdint.h">stdint.h</a> - header files that mimic the C99 standard boolean and standard integer types.  Nice to use if you want to make your programs have data sizes that are portable and consistant across platorms.  These are designed for the i386 protected mode architecture - size yours appropriately.</p>

<p><a href="code/timer.c">timer.c</a>, <a href="code/timer.h">timer.h</a> -
A timer library programmed in C for Win32 - using some extreme programming
techniques.  The timer is used to time things by marking the timer, and then
reading back the elapsed time of the timer.</p>

<p><a href="code/profile.c">profile.c</a>, <a href="code/profile.h">profile.h</a>,
<a href="code/rmspace.c">rmspace.c</a>, <a href="code/rmspace.h">rmspace.h</a>,
<a href="code/stptok.c">stptok.c</a>, <a href="code/stptok.h">stptok.h</a> -
Some C code with unit tests, written using test-first extreme programming best
practice, for reading and writing to INI files by simulating the Win32 API
functions WritePrivateProfileString and GetPrivateProfileString
(for Borland C++ <a href="code/profile.zip">profile.zip</a> or
for GCC <a href="code/profile.tgz">profile.tgz</a>).</p>

<p><a href="code/ctest.c">ctest.c</a>, <a href="code/ctest.h">ctest.h</a>,
<a href="code/bool.h">bool.h</a> - A C test library used for unit testing.</p>

<p><a href="code/graphics.cpp">graphics.cpp</a>, <a
  href="code/graphics.h">graphics.h</a>, and <a
  href="code/graphics.mak.html">graphics.mak</a> were written to draw primitive
shapes with the <a href="http://libsdl.org/">SDL</a> - Simple DirectMedia
Layer library.  The primitives include lines, circles, rectangles, and TTF
Text.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p><a href="http://geektools.com/">Geek Tools</a> If you are always looking
for a way to have all the external network resources that you use often,
at your fingertips (and all sorts of cool tools that seem to be in different
places that kept moving and disappearing as people moved around the net,
from company to company), here is a website, capable of being used by any
browser including LYNX, with minimal color (16) and minimal resolution (640
x 480), with no cookies, or Java.  See also the <a
  href="http://www.insecure.org/tools.html">Top 75 Security Tools</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snippets.org/">Software Snippets</a> - The SNIPPETS
collection started out in the late 1980's as a personal project to collect
useful snippets (hence the name) of C, and later C++, code which would be
free for reuse in a personal or commercial environment. Over time, it has
grown to more than 94,000 lines of code in over 700 separate files. The goal
of SNIPPETS is to collect and disseminate the best C/C++ answers to "How
do I...?" programming questions.</p>

<p>The <a
  href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/synedra/synedra.nsf">Stellation</a>
project at IBM Research is working on developing programming environments that
support collaboration between members of programming teams. <a
  href="http://www.tigris.org/">Tigris.org</a> is a mid-sized open source
community focused on building better tools for collaborative software
development. It provides information resources for software engineering
professionals and students, and a home for open source software engineering
tool projects, such as <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
for software configuration management.  Speaking of configuration management,
the distributed nature of <a href="http://wiki.gnuarch.org/">GNU Arch</a> and <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a> intrigues me.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

  <p>Best of breed - my favorite cross-platform, open source applications. I
  use <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> software for word
  processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and drawings. I use <a
    href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> for browsing and e-mail. I use
  <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/">FileZilla</a> for
  FTP client and FTP server on the Win32 platform. A nice, full featured
  graphical text editor with syntax highlighting and many other bells and
  whistles is <a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/">Vim</a>, or Vi IMproved - a
  programmers text editor. I like a full featured graphics editing tool called
  <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a> - the GNU Image Manipulation
  Program. If you like to play or edit sound, <a
    href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> is a good, simple
  audio editor suitable for recording, mixing, and editing ordinary tracks of
  CD-quality audio. Games I enjoy playing are <a
    href="http://tuxracer.sourceforge.net/">Tux Racer</a>, <a
    href="http://www.bzflag.org/">BZFlag</a>, <A
    href="http://www.reptilelabour.com/software/chromium/">Chromium BSU</A>,
  <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a>, and <a
    href="http://criticalmass.sourceforge.net/">Critical Mass</a>.   There
  are lots of games,
  such as <a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">Tux Paint</a>,  written using
  the <a href="http://libsdl.org/">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>, an
  open source, cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide fast
  access to the graphics framebuffer and audio device.  An open source,
  cross-platform native UI framework is <a
    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> (formerly called <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">wxWindows</a>).
  I also have a list of other <a href="win32.html">Open Source Software for
    Windows</a>.<p>

  <h3>Standards</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bacnet.org/">BACnet</a> - dedicated to providing the
  latest information on BACnet - A Data Communication Protocol for Building
  Automation and Control Networks. Developed under the auspices of the American
  Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (<a
    href="http://www.ashrae.org/">ASHRAE</a>), The protocol is supported and
  maintained by ASHRAE Standing Standard Project Committee 135. I help out on
  the committee, and also on the open source <a
    href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/vts/">Visual Test Shell</a>, an
  application for testing the BACnet functionality of various devices used in
  building automation systems. Project members are working on various
  enhancements to VTS as well as routine maintenance. I work on the open source <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet4linux/">BACnet for
    Linux</a> project and on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet/">embedded BACnet stack</a> project.  I also participate in the <a

    Working Group</a>, and the <a
    href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BACnetLighting/">BACnet Lighting
    Applications Working Group</a>.  I also gave a presentation once on <a
    href="docs/UsingBACnetLighting.pdf">Using BACnet for Lighting
    Applications</a>. Aren't standards bodies wonderful?</p>

  <p>Speaking of standards,
  the <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/">The Requests for Comments</a> (RFC)
  document series, a set of technical and organizational notes about the
  Internet, is available.</p>

  <h3>Software Process</h3>

  <p><a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> -
    Extreme Programming , or XP for short, is a code-centric discipline for
    getting software done right, on time, within budget, while having fun along
    the way. The XP approach is to take the best software practices to the
    extreme. <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Another XP site</a>
    has a great tutorial which includes an introduction and overview. <a
      href="http://www.freshsources.com/">Chuck Allison</a> wrote a great
    article in C/C++ Users Journal about the <a
	    href="docs/simplest_unit_test.pdf">The
      Simplest Automated Unit Test Framework That Could Possibly Work</a>. It
    included test frameworks written in <a
      href="ftp://192.215.71.136/pub/2000/cujsep2000.zip">C, C++,and Java</a>
    and opened my eyes to doing best practices to the extreme. What? You're not
    programming in one of those languages? You can download <a
      href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">Test Frameworks</a> for
    other languages.<p>

<p><A HREF="http://www.sdmagazine.com/">Software Development Magazine</a> had an <A HREF="http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=7147/sdm0206b/0206b.htm">article about test first programming</a> of a GUI application that describes a method of incorporating <A HREF="http://www.junit.org/">automated testing</a> into the application.  The example GUI application is a <A HREF="http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=7147/sdm0206b/jlangrdots.zip">simple game</a>, but the design pattern, <A HREF="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/ModelViewPresenter.html">Model-View-Presenter</a>, could be used for any GUI application. <i>"In <A HREF="http://www.object-arts.com/EducationCentre/Patterns/MVP.htm">MVP</a>, the View actually serves as both the view and controller (presenting output and managing input). The Model is the Model, as in MVC. The extra middle layer is considered a bridge between the View and the Model. It's specific to the application and is often considered throwaway if the View needs to change (for example) from Swing to HTML. In this situation, the Model would remain unchanged."</i></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/">A Pattern Language</a> has the
  structure of a network.  A broad sweep through <a
  href="http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P0.htm">the patterns</a> can capture
  some idea of and summarises or indexes the full network. Once you get this
  overview, you will then be able to find the patterns which are relevant to your
  own project and from these, using neighboring patterns in the network, able to
  identify other patterns that you may want to include.</p>

<p>Software engineers need certain things to help them be productive.  <a
  href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> writes about the <a
  href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">Bionic
  Office</a>.  He says that there's a lot of evidence that the right kind of
office space can improve programmer productivity, especially private offices
with doors that close.  Most of the documented evidence comes from <a
  href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633439/">Peopleware</a>.
Productivity boosts come from being "in the zone," a state where the knowledge
worker is able to fully concentrate on their work and tune out their
environment.  It takes an average of 15 minutes to get into the zone, but
noise, phone calls, lunch, and other interruptions can easily and instantly
knock the worker out of the zone. Prevent the interruptions and you can get a
260% productivity increase.</p>
